本年度 GDG DevFest 將於11月11日於香港城市大學舉行。今年我們將兵分四路，帶來超過16個環節，涵蓋Android，Cloud，Machine Learning，及STEM 教育等不同範疇。

自2010年起，DevFest一直是我們每年最大型的活動，參與人數由約80人到去年超過300人。這一直支持著我們發展，去為香港的資訊科技行業建設一個可持續發展的生態圈。

一個良好的生態圈並不能單靠我們這一群開發者，所以今年我們亦邀請了 Women Techmakers 及 Google CS First，將我們的願景帶給每一個人。

GDG DevFest 是一個免費的活動，由開發者舉辦，為開發者而設。在這裡你將會得到由Google，行業領袖，科創企業，及本地社區所帶來的行業資訊。


GDG DevFest, our annual developer conference for the developer community, will be held on 11-Nov in City University of Hong Kong. This year, we have one more track compare with last year. We have 4 tracks and over 16 sessions covering areas of Android, Cloud, Machine Learning, STEM Education, and more.

Since 2010, DevFest has become our largest event of the year. From one single track with 80 people, to 4 tracks with over 300 people. We bring the best to the community, to build a sustainable ecosystem in the industry.

Not only more sessions for more people. We understand a healthy ecosystem cannot be just formed by us. So, this year, we also bring Women Techmakers and Google CS First with us. To bring the same message to the young developers, and beyond the limit of genders.

With speakers from Google, Industry Leads, Startups, and Local Communities, we bring the best content to the community. If you miss it, you will have to wait for another year. And most important is, the event is FREE.
